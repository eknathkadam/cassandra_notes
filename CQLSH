CREATE TABLE PERSON (first_name text,last_name text, id text, PRIMARY KEY (id));DESCRIBE TABLE person;
SELECT * FROM person;
INSERT INTO person (first_name, last_name, id) VALUES ('Eknath', 'Kadam','1');
SELECT * FROM person WHERE id='1' works fine becuase its primary key
SELECT * FROM person WHERE name='Eknath' doesnt work
INSERT INTO person (first_name, last_name, id) VALUES ('Eknath1', 'Kadam1', 1);
Above statement is known as upsert, CASSANDRA WILL Update a record if the primary key exists.
DELETE FROM person WHERE id = '1'; This is a legit statement. But cassandra wont delete from other columns
TRUNCATE person; will delete all data from person table
DROP TABLE person; will delete the table itself
